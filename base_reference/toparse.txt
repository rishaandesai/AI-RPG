You find yourself at the edge of the ancient Whispering Forest, the canopy above thick with intertwined branches that block out most of the sunlight. The air is thick with the scent of pine and earth, and the distant sound of a flowing river reaches your ears. As you take your first steps onto the moss-covered path, you feel a slight pang of hunger and thirst.

You proceed deeper into the forest, the trees growing taller and the foliage denser. Suddenly, you hear a rustling in the bushes ahead.

A shadowy figure emerges from the underbrushâ€”it's a hooded ranger with piercing eyes. They raise a hand in greeting but remain cautious.

You decide to engage in conversation with the ranger.

The ranger nods and hands you a worn map, indicating key locations within the forest.

Feeling refreshed by the interaction, you continue your journey.

You come across a small clearing with a bubbling spring. The water looks clean and inviting.

You drink from the spring, quenching your thirst and feeling your health improve slightly.

As night falls, you decide to set up camp. You hear noises in the darkness.

You manage to fend off the wolves but sustain injuries in the process. Your wooden shield is damaged beyond repair.

Examining the campsite, you find a broken sword and notice that the rations have been consumed, likely by wildlife or hostile forces.

Continuing your exploration, you find a hidden path leading upwards towards a distant mountain peak.
