## Welcome to AI RPG!
AI RPG is a project that uses local LLMs such as Llama 3.2 through a platform called Ollama. 
It uses curses to generate the TUI (terminal user interface) and generate the story for the user. 

To run it locally, just change the filepath of instructions.txt in main.py, and change the filepath of instructions.txt
Additionally, install Ollama and run "ollama run llama3.2"

NOTE: The above instructions are for the old version (located in the old/* directory). To try out the new version (extremely buggy and may not work), run ui.py after installing Ollama.
