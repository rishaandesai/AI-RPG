## **2. GAMEPLAY**

### **2.1. Core Mechanics**

#### **a. Dice Rolls**
- **Purpose:** Introduce randomness and uncertainty into various aspects of the game, including skill checks, combat outcomes, and loot generation.
- **Usage Scenarios:**
  - **Skill Checks:** Determine success or failure of actions based on character stats.
  - **Combat:** Resolve attack and defense outcomes.
  - **Loot Generation:** Randomly determine items found or rewards received.

#### **b. State Management (`<state>` Tag)**
- **Purpose:** Keep track of and update the game’s current state, including player stats, inventory, and gold.
- **Structure:**
  ```html
  <state>
  {
    "stats": {"Health": +10, "Strength": -2},
    "inventory": {"add": ["Health Potion"], "remove": ["Old Sword"]},
    "gold": 50
  }
  </state>

	•	Functionality:
	•	Stats: Modify player attributes by adding or subtracting values.
	•	Inventory: Add new items or remove existing ones from the player’s inventory.
	•	Gold: Adjust the player’s gold by adding or subtracting amounts.

c. Player Information Access

	•	Command: Typing “c” at any time allows the player to view their character’s current information.
	•	Displayed Information:
	•	Name
	•	Age
	•	Species
	•	Characteristics
	•	Gold
	•	All character stats

2.2. Inventory and Purchasing System

a. Inventory Management

	•	Components:
	•	Items: Stored in the inventory list.
	•	Additions: Use the <state> tag to add items.
	•	Removals: Use the <state> tag to remove items.

b. Purchasing Items

	•	Process:
	•	Players can purchase items using gold.
	•	Deduct the cost from the player’s gold and add the item to the inventory.
	•	Example:

You visit the merchant and decide to buy a Health Potion.
<state>
{
  "gold": -10,
  "inventory": {"add": ["Health Potion"]}
}
</state>

This deducts 10 gold and adds a Health Potion to the inventory.

2.3. Player Choices and Narrative Flow

a. Free Choice Mechanism

	•	Guideline: Never provide predefined action options like “Attack or Run”. Instead, present scenarios that allow the player to choose their own path.
	•	Example:
	•	Good Practice: “The figure regards you warily. What do you do?”
	•	Bad Practice: “Do you want to attack, run, or talk to the NPC?”

b. Dynamic Story Shaping

	•	Mechanism: The player’s choices directly influence the direction and outcome of the story.
	•	Implementation:
	•	Use conditional tags (<if>) to branch narratives based on player stats or variables.
	•	Update the game state accordingly to reflect the consequences of choices.
